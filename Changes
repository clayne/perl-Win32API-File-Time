  Code and documentation clean-up.

  Convert to Test::More.

  Add machinery to test (though not use) on non-Windows systems.

0.007		2016-01-26	T. R. Wyant
  Use 'our' for $VERSION, exporter symbols

  Have {Makefile,Build}.PL die unless MSWin32 or cygwin. There is a
    back door if environment variable AUTHOR_BUILD is true, so I can
    build a kit.

  Have t/basic.t skip if can't load Windows modules.

  Bring Changes file into compliance with Test::CPAN::Changes, and add
    test xt/author/changes.t to make sure it stays that way.

  Require Test::More 0.88 for building.

  Move the modification history into the Changes file.

  Update minimum Perl from 5.005 to 5.006002, since that is the minimum I
    have been able to actually build.

  Make the code as perlcritic-compliant as I think reasonable.

  Convert to CPAN-recommented license.

  Tweak t/basic.t to work under ReactOS.

  Assert FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS when reading times, so that it works
    for directories under XP and 2003 server. Thanks to Leigh Power for
    pointing out the problem and suggesting the solution.

  Document FAT, and accomodate it in self-test. Thanks again, Leigh.

  Centralize code to close handles on error.
